IndexedDB is a low-level API that provides client storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files and blobs. For high-performance searches on that data use indexes. While DOM Storage is useful for storing small amounts of data, it is not useful for storing large amounts of structured data. IndexedDB provides a solution.
